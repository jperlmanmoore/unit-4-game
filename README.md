This is a RPG game with a Star Wars theme. It uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, as well as Javascript and JQuery. In this project most of the content was dynamically rendered, including the movements of the cards as player characters are picked and as enemy characters remain. The character stats and actions are controlled with javascript and JQuery.
